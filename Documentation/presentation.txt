- Purpose of the project

History of Enigma (QUICKLY)
- Inception
	- intitally pitched to the German navy and the foreign office, neither was interested.
	- in 1927 a new Enigma was realeased, which was widely adopted by many contries uncluding the UK, the US, and the Japanesse.
	- between 1930-1938 the Enigma was altered and adopted by much of the german armed forces.
- designs
- uses

History of BOMBE (QUICKLY)
- Polish mathematicianâ€“cryptologist Marian Rejewski able to work out the wireing of the Enigma.
- designed a Logic bombe called the "bomba kryptologiczna"
	- made up of 6 enigma representations.
- Re-Designed in 1939 by Alan Turing
- revised in 1940 by Gordon Welchman
- Produced by the British Tabulating Machine Company
- significant development on the polish version of the LOGIC BOMBE
	- much larger
	- much faster
