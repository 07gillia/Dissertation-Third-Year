\section*{Definition of Problem Background, Environment and Themes (Page 1)}

- how parallel computing could be used to address limitations with BOMBE\\
- History of Alan Turing?\\
- defintion of encoding/decoding and other cryptographic words\\
\\
- encoding\\
- cipher\\
- history of Enigma\\
- history of BOMBE\\
- how they relate\\

\section*{Issues Identified in Texts (Page 2-4)}

- definitions of the individual components of enigma\\
- definition of Enigma\\
- how it works exactly\\
- limitations of Enigma\\
- defintions of individual components of BOMBE\\
- definition of BOMBE\\
- how it works exactly\\
- limitations of BOMBE\\
- definition of parallel computation/programming/etc.\\
- the methods in which parallelization can be applied to BOMBE\\
- how parallel computing could be used to address limitations with BOMBE\\

\section*{Proposed Direction of the Project (Page 5)}

- basic making and testing of both enigma and BOMBE\\
- paralleize BOMBE (possibly in two different ways) and test\\
- elaborate on this and make sure that the requ spec is mentioned\\

\section*{Conclusion (Page 6)}

Ask what goes in this section when the first draft is sent, all bullet points should be done at this point.\\
